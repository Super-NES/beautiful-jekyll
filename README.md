# Conclave: The Case Study

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site was created using the [beautiful-jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) to house the case study our team wrote about a real-time, collaborative text editor that we built called [Conclave](https://conclave-app.herokuapp.com/).

Visit the [site](https://conclave-team.github.io/conclave-site/) to see what it all looks like.
